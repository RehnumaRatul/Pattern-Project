Project Title: Stock Price Detection.

Problem Definition: Prediction of stock price and stock price movement patterns has always been a critical area of research. While the well-known efficient market hypothesis rules out any possibility of accurate prediction of stock prices, there are formal propositions in the literature demonstrating accurate modeling of the predictive systems can enable us to predict stock prices with a very high level of accuracy. In this project, we present a suite of deep learning-based regression models that yields a very high level of accuracy in stock price prediction.
